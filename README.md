This is incredibly hacky, but in short, this app does a few things:

1. Read in gateway events from APNS
2. Fetch data such as avatars
3. Formats them nicely for iOS 15

Supported features include:

* Avatars in Communication Notifications
* Per-account notification customization
* Associated contacts for Focus integration on iOS 15
* PluralKit support (note: *very* experimental)
